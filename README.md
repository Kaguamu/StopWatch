⏱️ Stopwatch Project

This project is a simple stopwatch application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, created to strengthen my understanding of time tracking, DOM updates, and event handling in the browser.

The focus is on practicing core JavaScript logic and building a responsive, interactive UI without external libraries or frameworks.

🔑 Key Concepts Practiced

🎨 Features

Start / Stop toggle

Lap recording with a running list

Reset functionality to clear the timer and laps

Millisecond precision formatting (hh:mm:ss.ms)
